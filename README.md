The use of deep learning algorithms has been a game-changer in the field of cardiovascular imaging, allowing for the extraction of
intricate features and patterns from ECG data, resulting in highly accurate classification of various cardiac conditions. This article
aims to explore the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory
layers in ECG classification, highlighting their ability to capture temporal dependencies and noise while offering interpretability of
hidden states. Additionally, we will discuss the advantages of deep learning approaches over traditional machine learning solutions,
which often rely on heuristic hand-crafted features or shallow learning architectures. Through an extensive analysis of more than
300 research articles in the medical field, it has been determined that deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural
networks and recurrent neural networks with LSTM layers, have shown great promise in the classification of ECG data. These deep
learning algorithms have the advantage of not requiring hand-crafted or engineered features, as they can automatically learn and
extract relevant features from the raw ECG data (Romiti et al., 2020). Furthermore, these deep learning techniques have
demonstrated superior performance compared to human results, showcasing their ability to accurately classify various cardiac
conditions without the need for manual intervention.
METHODOLOGIES:
A. CNN Model
The entire document should We used Deep Learning techniques such as CNN, RNN with LSTM layers and proposed two models
where first model is actually CNN and secondly we combined CNN with RNN. This model architecture starts with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) component, consisting of three Conv2D layers. The first Conv2D layer has 32 filters with a filter size of 3x3
and utilizes the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. It takes input images with a shape of 150x150 pixels and 3 color
channels, representing RGB. Following the Conv2D layer, a MaxPooling2D layer with a pool size of 2x2 is applied to downsample
the feature maps. The figure 1 shows the CNN model architecture.
